                        <p class="lead">We provide a helping hand to a productive, clean, and sober life.</p>
                        <p class="ita">I am really greatful for Hawkes Home. They gave me the chance to start my new life (a real life). What I have experienced here is a clean and sober environment, a place where I feel safe. What the Hawkes has done and is doing for me is giving me an affordable place where I can be a productive member in this society. I owe my life, the way it is today, to Hawkes Home.</p>
                        <p>&mdash; Butch</p>
                        <p>When I decided to change my life, the Hawkes House provided a safe environment with well-rounded people to support me. I proceeded forward in taking the steps I needed to take to become a pro­active and positive member of today's society. Thank you, Hawkes House.</p>
                        <p>&mdash; Dwayne</p>
                        <p>Hawkes Home has done so much for me. When I got here, I had nothing in my life. Now my life is 100% better than ever. Now I am manager here, I get to help other men in their journey in recovery. One of the big things in my life, I have good in my life now.</p>
                        <p>&mdash; Clyde</p>
                        <p>I believe Hawkes Home provides men an affordable opportunity to better their lives in a loving manner. By giving these men a safe and structured environment, they are able to grow as individuals and become productive members of our society. As a house manager, I'm able to work with these men and see the growth in them. As an addict myself, working with the men is helping me stay sober. Teaching me a new set of skills and compassion when it comes to dealing with life's problems.</p>
                        <p>&mdash; Bruce</p>
                        <p>I was recently released from prison, no home, no family, feeling hopeless. I told myself I would do whatever it takes to never go back to prison. My first day out I attended an AA meeting and got myself a sponsor and someone gave me a number for sober living (Hawkes Home). Feeling desperate, I called and spoke with the house manager. I was told they were full. Then I explained my situation and was told to call back. I did and the manager said they could help me by offering the couch to sleep on until I could figure something out. With a place to sleep, I could start looking for a job. Hawkes Home helped me get some clothes and a bus pass. I was employed within a week and put a down payment on a car in two weeks. I have never felt so blessed. I honestly don't know where I would be if it weren't for Hawkes Home. Thank you for the love and support!</p>
                        <p>&mdash; Michael</p>
                        <p>Hawkes Home has created a peaceful environment for me. I transitioned here after I graduated from rehab. Thanks to Hawkes Home, I've been able to keep my sobriety. It's an elite transitional home compared to other homes here in Vista.</p>

                        <h3>Non-Profit</h3>
                        <p>Hawkes Home, Inc., a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation was formed to provide temporary housing and reentry education for men exiting prison or jail. As our clients strive to reclaim their dignity and rebuild their lives, they face the daunting challenge of adjusting to the changes in society that took place during their confinement.</p>
                        <h3>Participation</h3>
                        <p>Through participation in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and by using their newly-acquired life skills, clients will be encouraged to avoid old contacts and the destructive behaviors that originally led to their incarceration.</p>
                        <h3>Business of Living</h3>
                        <p>Clients will have opportunities to learn the practical skills of the business of living. Skills such as job searching, money management, computer proficiency, health maintenance, independent living, and other abilities are explored to help launch new lives for themselves on the outside as productive members of society.</p>
                        <p>The success of these men at Hawkes Home translates to a better world for all! </p>
