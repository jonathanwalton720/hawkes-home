            <h1>House Guidelines</h1>
            <h3>Period of Residence</h3>
            <p>Length of stay in Hawkes Home is determined by the willingness to follow house rules and the ability to secure employment, as discussed with House Management. </p>
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>Clients must be willing to live peacefully with all other residents in the house. No violence, gossip, racial epithets, or disrespectful behavior is tolerated. Rules need to be followed with a spirit of teamwork to promote a positive environment
              within the home.</p>
            <h3>Chores</h3>
            <p>Chores are assigned daily and must be completed without complaint as directed by House Management before leaving in the morning, or after returning in the evening. Beds must be neatly made each morning, possessions stored in closets or drawers,
              and all personal care items stored out of sight.</p>
            <h3>Food/Meals</h3>
            <p>Basic food items are provided by Hawkes Home. Clients are welcome to prepare and eat breakfast at the house. Breakfast must be finished and the kitchen cleaned by 8:15 am. Hawkes Home has an open kitchen policy. Clients may eat at anytime
              during kitchen hours. Food must be eaten in the kitchen or on the backyard patio. Food and drink (except water) are not allowed in the bedrooms. Clients must clean up after themselves. All personal food items need to be labeled with a name
              and stored neatly. Kitchen needs to be cleaned up and closed down by 9:00 pm.</p>
            <h3>Weapons/Drugs/Alcohol</h3>
            <p>No weapons, drugs, or alcohol are permitted on the premises. For everyoneâ€™s safety, belongings may be subject to inspection upon entry to the house. Clients will also be asked to submit to a drug test prior to admission and to random testing
              during their stay.</p>
            <h3>Medication</h3>
            <p>All medication (prescription or nonprescription) must be disclosed to House Management.</p>
            <h3>Bathroom</h3>
            <p>Daily bathing is required. Each client is responsible for cleaning the bathroom after every use. Personal towels and other hygiene items should never be left in the bathroom. Clients should be considerate of others and not tie up the bathroom
              unnecessarily.
            </p>
            <h3>Laundry</h3>
            <p>Laundry may be done at anytime. Clients need to wipe down the washer or dryer and clean the lint filter after each use. Laundry soap is provided for a small fee per load to help offset the cost of running the house. Clients may not leave the
              premises while they have laundry in either the washer or dryer. They may not leave laundry in the washer or dryer overnight.</p>
            <h3>Fees</h3>
